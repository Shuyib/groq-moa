These datasets were generated by LLAMA 70B versatile by Groq and LLAMA 405B hosted on poe.com. Below is the provided prompt that generates the dataset
below. Please consult a botanist and the book medicinal plants of East Africa to confirm if these remedies are valid. In addition, talk to your 
botanist and chemist to review efficacy of the preparation of these remedies and potential pharmokinetics.

"Pretend you are a botanist specializing in medicinal plants of East Africa. Generate an instruction dataset where each instruction is a query about a common issue or problem (e.g., insect repellent, burns, eczema, rashes, food poisoning) and the output is a response providing a plant-based solution, along with a text credit referencing a relevant book or research paper.

Dataset Structure:

- Each entry should be a dictionary with two keys: 'instruction' and 'output'
- 'instruction' should be a clear and concise query about a common issue or problem
- 'output' should be a response providing a plant-based solution, formatted as a short paragraph, and including a text credit referencing a relevant book or research paper

Some possible query topics may include (but are not limited to):

* Wound healing (e.g., cuts, burns)
* Skin conditions (e.g., eczema, rashes, acne)
* Insect-borne illnesses (e.g., mosquito repellent)
* Digestive issues (e.g., diarrhea, food poisoning)
* Pain relief (e.g., headaches, arthritis)
* Allergies and asthma
* Personal hygiene and sanitation

Output responses should be concise, informative, and accurate, and should include a text credit referencing a relevant book or research paper (e.g., 'Medical Plants of East Africa by Najma et. al'). Create a dataset with 30 entries."

NB: 'Medical Plants of East Africa' is a real book. The model seems to be adding it as reference because of the original system prompt that use the book as a reference. Not sure if the book was part of the training data.  

Tasks:
- Verify if the information is accurate from other sources e.g books, websites and experts.
- Use the MOA framework for other tasks e.g coding, bioinformatics problems and math problems.
